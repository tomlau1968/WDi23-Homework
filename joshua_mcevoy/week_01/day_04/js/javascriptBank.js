// In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. The bank has many
//accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.
//
// Bank
//
// There is only one bank. This bank has an array of accounts. The bank needs a
//method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts. It also needs an
//addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank and add it to the array of accounts.
//There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.
//
// The bank has many accounts. Accounts should be objects that all share a set of common functionality.
//



// let bank = [ 356.49, 1035.13, 3000.99, 543.51 ];
//
//
// const totalSum = function () {
//   let total = 0;
//   for (let i = 0; i < bank.length; i++){
//     total += bank[i];
//   }
//   console.log(total);
// };
//
// const addAccount = function (amount){
//   bank.push(amount);
// };
//
//
// totalSum();
// addAccount(172.45);

// Accounts
//
// Accounts have a current balance and owner's name. You should be able to deposit or
//withdraw from an account to change the balance.
//
// There is no need to write a user interface. Make sure functions return values
//-- you may also have your functions console.log() values to help you see your code working.
//
// You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that
//shows that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the
//total balance, make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.


let bank = [
  {
    currentBalance: ,
    ownersName: "",

  }

]
